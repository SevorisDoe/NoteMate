> The perfect companion for working with your notes 

NoteMate is a programmatic transformation tool used to parse and manipulate files whose heading structure and contents follow [the Open Knowledge Model](https://jacobzelko.com/04172022033744-open-knowledge-standard/index.html). Due to the way NoteMate internally represents documents, it is possible to transform notes from different structures to the Open Knowledge Model standard, and to express the standard in different output formats.

NoteMate helps build [digital gardens](https://www.lekoarts.de/garden/what-is-a-digital-garden) for the sharing of ideas, insights and information synthesis. It works with files that empathize native human readability and manipulation without dependency on complex machine-readable metadata linkages in the frontend. Citations and information sources are inspired by academic standards and can be natively copied and pasted. This makes it a good choice for building digital gardens that can be grown with a high-quality, low-tech evidence chain. 

The strong suite of NoteMate is bringing this from the local storage to an intermediate structure you can then translate into various other formats suitable for web hosting or other plattforms.
